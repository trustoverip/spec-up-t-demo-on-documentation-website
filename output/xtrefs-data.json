In the context of [[ref: identification]], scope refers to the set of possible entities within which a specific entity must be uniquely identified. In the context of [[ref: specifications]], scope refers to the set of problems (the problem space) within which the specification is intended to specify solutions.\n\n~ Supporting definitions:\n\n~ [eSSIF-Lab](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#scope): the extent of the area or subject matter (which we use, e.g., to define [pattern](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/@), [concept](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/@), [term](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/@) and [glossaries](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/@) in, but it serves other purposes as well).\n"
