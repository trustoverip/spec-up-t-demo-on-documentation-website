[[def: node, nodes]]
~ In telecommunications networks, a node (Latin: nodus, ‘knot’) is either a redistribution point or a [[ref: communication endpoint]]. The definition of a node depends on the network and [[ref: protocol layer]] referred to. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a [[ref: communication channel]].
