[[def: pseudonym, pseudonyms, pseudonymous, pseudonymity]]

~ A pseudonym is a fictitious name that a [[ref: person]] assumes for a particular purpose, which differs from their original or true name (orthonym). This also differs from a new name that entirely or legally replaces an individual's own. Many pseudonym [[ref: holders]] use pseudonyms because they wish to remain [[ref: anonymous]], but anonymity is difficult to achieve and often fraught with legal issues.
