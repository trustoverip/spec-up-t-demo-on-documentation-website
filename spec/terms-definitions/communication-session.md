[[def: communication session, communication sessions, communications session, communications sessions]]
~ A finite period for which a [[ref: communication channel]] is instantiated and maintained, during which certain [[ref: properties]] of that channel, such as authentication of the participants, are in effect. A session has a beginning, called the session initiation, and an ending, called the session termination.

~ [NIST-CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/session): A persistent interaction between a subscriber and an end point, either a relying party or a Credential Service Provider. A session begins with an authentication event and ends with a session termination event. A session is bound by use of a session secret that the subscriber’s software (a browser, application, or operating system) can present to the relying party or the Credential Service Provider in lieu of the subscriber’s authentication credentials.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_\(computer_science\)): In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) in particular, a session is a time-delimited two-way link, a practical (relatively high) layer in the [TCP/IP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) enabling interactive expression and information exchange between two or more communication devices or ends – be they computers, [automated systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation), or live active users (see [login session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login_session)). A session is established at a certain point in time, and then ‘torn down’ - brought to an end - at some later point. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is typically [stateful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful), meaning that at least one of the communicating parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the session history to be able to communicate, as opposed to [stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_server) communication, where the communication consists of independent [requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request-response) with responses. An established session is the basic requirement to perform a [connection-oriented communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication). A session also is the basic step to transmit in [connectionless communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication) modes. However, any unidirectional transmission does not define a session.
