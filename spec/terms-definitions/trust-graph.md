More complex trust graphs can be recorded or registered in and queried from a [[ref: trust registry]]. Trust graphs can also be expressed using [[ref: trust chains]] and [[ref: chained credentials]]. Trust graphs can enable [[ref: verifiers]] and [[ref: relying parties]] to make [[ref: transitive trust decisions]].
