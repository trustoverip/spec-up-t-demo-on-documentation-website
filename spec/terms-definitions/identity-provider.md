[[def: identity provider, identity providers, IdP, IdPs]]

~ An identity provider (abbreviated IdP or IDP) is a system [[ref: entity]] that creates, maintains, and manages [[ref: identity]] information for [[ref: principals]] and also provides [[ref: authentication]] services to relying applications within a [[ref: federation]] or distributed network.

~ Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider).

~ Note: The term “identity provider” is used in [[ref: federated identity]] systems because it is a required component of their architecture. By contrast, [[ref: decentralized identity]] and [[ref: self-sovereign identity]] systems do not use the term because they are architected to enable [[ref: entities]] to create and control their own [[ref: digital identities]] without the need to depend on an external provider.
