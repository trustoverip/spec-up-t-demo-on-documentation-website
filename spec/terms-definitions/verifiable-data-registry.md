[[def: verifiable data registry, verifiable data registries, VDR, VDRs]]
~ A [[ref: registry]] that facilitates the creation, [[ref: verification]], updating, and/or deactivation of [[ref: decentralized identifiers]] and [[ref: DID documents]]. A verifiable data registry may also be used for other [[ref: cryptographically-verifiable]] data structures such as [[ref: verifiable credentials]].

~ Note: There is an [earlier definition in the W3C VC 1.1. glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology) that is not as mature as this one (it is not clear about the use of cryptographically verifiable data structures). We do not recommend that definition.
