[[def: zero-knowledge service, zero-knowledge services]]
~ In cloud computing, the term “zero-knowledge” refers to an online service that stores, transfers or manipulates [[ref: data]] in a way that maintains a high level of [[ref: confidentiality]], where the data is only accessible to the [[ref: data]]'s [[ref: owner]] (the client), and not to the service provider. This is achieved by [[ref: encrypting]] the raw data at the client's side or end-to-end (in case there is more than one client), without disclosing the password to the service provider. This means that neither the service provider, nor any [[ref: third party]] that might intercept the [[ref: data]], can [[ref: decrypt]] and access the [[ref: data]] without prior permission, allowing the client a higher degree of privacy than would otherwise be possible. In addition, zero-knowledge services often strive to hold as little [[ref: metadata]] as possible, holding only that [[ref: data]] that is functionally needed by the service.
