[[def: End-to-End Principle]]

~ The end-to-end principle is a design framework in computer networking. In networks designed according to this principle, guaranteeing certain application-specific features, such as reliability and security, requires that they reside in the communicating end [[ref: nodes]] of the network. [[ref: Intermediary]] nodes, such as [[ref: gateways]] and [[ref: routers]], that exist to establish the network, may implement these to improve efficiency but cannot guarantee end-to-end correctness.
