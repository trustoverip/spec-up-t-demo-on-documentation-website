[[def: encryption, encrypt, encrypts, encrypted, encrypting]]
~ Cryptographic transformation of [[ref: data]] (called [[ref: plaintext]]) into a form (called [[ref: ciphertext]]) that conceals the [[ref: data]]'s original meaning to prevent it from being known or used. If the transformation is reversible, the corresponding reversal process is called [[ref: decryption]], which is a transformation that restores encrypted [[ref: data]] to its original state.
