[[def: unicast]]
~ In computer networking, unicast is a one-to-one transmission from one point in the network to another point; that is, one sender and one receiver, each identified by a [[ref: network address]] (a [[ref: unicast address]]). Unicast is in contrast to [[ref: multicast]] and [[ref: broadcast]] which are one-to-many transmissions. [[ref: Internet Protocol]] unicast delivery methods such as [[ref: Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and [[ref: User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) are typically used.
