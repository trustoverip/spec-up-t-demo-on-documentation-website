~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema): An XML schema is a description of a type of [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Markup_Language) document, typically expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents of that type, above and beyond the basic syntactical constraints imposed by XML itself. These constraints are generally expressed using some combination of grammatical rules governing the order of elements, [Boolean predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_predicates) that the content must satisfy, data types governing the content of elements and attributes, and more specialized rules such as [uniqueness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_quantification) and [referential integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity) constraints.
