[[def: public key cryptography]]

~ Public key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related [[ref: keys]]. Each key pair consists of a [[ref: public key]] and a corresponding [[ref: private key]]. [[ref: Key pairs]] are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. Security of public key cryptography depends on keeping the [[ref: private key]] secret; the [[ref: public key]] can be openly distributed without compromising security.
