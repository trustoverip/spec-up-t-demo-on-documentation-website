[[def: Uniform Resource Name, Uniform Resource Names, URN, URNs]]
~ A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a type of URI ([[ref: Uniform Resource Identifier]]) designed for persistent identifiers that are intended to be assigned once to a resource and never changed to identify a different resource. In some cases a URN is also intended to serve as a persistent way to locate the identified resource over time even as it moves locations on the network. The URN standard is defined by [IETF RFC 8141](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141).
