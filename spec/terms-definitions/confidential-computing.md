~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing): Confidential computing is a security and [privacy-enhancing computational technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies) focused on protecting [data in use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_in_use). Confidential computing can be used in conjunction with storage and network encryption, which protect [data at rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest) and [data in transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_in_transit) respectively. It is designed to address software, protocol, cryptographic, and basic physical and supply-chain attacks, although some critics have demonstrated architectural and [side-channel attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack) effective against the technology.
