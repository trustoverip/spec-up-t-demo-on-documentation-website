[[def: trusted execution environment, trusted execution environments, TEE, TEEs]]
~ A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure area of a main processor. It helps code and data loaded inside it to be protected with respect to [[ref: confidentiality]] and [[ref: integrity]]. Data [[ref: integrity]] prevents [[ref: unauthorized]] [[ref: entities]] from outside the TEE from altering [[ref: data]], while code integrity prevents code in the TEE from being replaced or modified by [[ref: unauthorized]] [[ref: entities]], which may also be the computer [[ref: owner]] itself as in certain [[ref: DRM]] schemes.
