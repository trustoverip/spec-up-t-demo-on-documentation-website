[[def: protocol layer, protocol layers]]

~ In modern protocol design, protocols are layered to form a [[ref: protocol stack]]. Layering is a design principle that divides the protocol design task into smaller steps, each of which accomplishes a specific part, interacting with the other parts of the protocol only in a small number of well-defined ways. Layering allows the parts of a protocol to be designed and tested without a combinatorial explosion of cases, keeping each design relatively simple.
