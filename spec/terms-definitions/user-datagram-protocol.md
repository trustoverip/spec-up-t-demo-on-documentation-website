[[def: User Datagram Protocol]]
~ In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core [[ref: communication]] protocols of the [[ref: Internet protocol suite]] used to send [[ref: messages]] (transported as [[ref: datagrams]] in [[ref: packets]]) to other hosts on an [[ref: Internet Protocol]] (IP) network. Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up [[ref: communication channels]] or data paths.
