[[def: public key certificate, public key certificates, PKC, PKCs]]

~ A set of [[ref: data]] that uniquely identifies a [[ref: public key]] (which has a corresponding [[ref: private key]]) and an [[ref: owner]] that is authorized to use the [[ref: key pair]]. The certificate contains the owner’s [[ref: public key]] and possibly other information and is [[ref: digitally signed]] by a [[ref: certification authority]] (i.e., a trusted [[ref: party]]), thereby binding the [[ref: public key]] to the [[ref: owner]].

~ Wikipedia : In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), a public key certificate, also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate, is an [electronic document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_document) used to prove the validity of a [public key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_authentication). The certificate includes information about the key, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the [digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents (called the issuer). If the signature is valid, and the software examining the certificate trusts the issuer, then it can use that key to communicate securely with the certificate's subject. In [email encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_encryption), [code signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing), and [e-signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_signature) systems, a certificate's subject is typically a person or organization. However, in [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (TLS) a certificate's subject is typically a computer or other device, though TLS certificates may identify organizations or individuals in addition to their core role in identifying devices.
