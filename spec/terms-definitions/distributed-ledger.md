[[def: distributed ledger, distributed ledgers, DLT, DLTs]]

~ A distributed ledger (also called a shared ledger or distributed ledger technology or DLT) is the consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital [[ref: data]] that is geographically spread (distributed) across many sites, countries, or institutions. In contrast to a centralized database, a distributed ledger does not require a central administrator, and consequently does not have a single (central) point-of-failure. In general, a distributed ledger requires a [[ref: peer-to-peer]] (P2P) computer network and consensus algorithms so that the ledger is reliably replicated across distributed computer [[ref: nodes]] (servers, clients, etc.). The most common form of distributed ledger technology is the [[ref: blockchain]], which can either be on a public or private network.
