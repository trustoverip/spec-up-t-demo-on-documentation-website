~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment): Risk assessment determines possible mishaps, their likelihood and consequences, and the [tolerances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance) for such events.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment#cite_note-RausandRisk13-1) The results of this process may be expressed in a [quantitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property) or [qualitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_data) fashion. Risk assessment is an inherent part of a broader [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management) strategy to help reduce any potential risk-related consequences. More precisely, risk assessment identifies and analyses potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e. [hazard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_analysis)). It also makes judgments "on the [tolerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability) of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis" while considering influencing factors (i.e. risk evaluation).
