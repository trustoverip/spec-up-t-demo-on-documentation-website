[[def: router, routers]]

~ A router is a networking device that forwards [[ref: data packets]] between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions between networks and on the global Internet. Data sent through a network, such as a web page or email, is in the form of [[ref: data packets]]. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination [[ref: node]]. This process is called [[ref: routing]].
