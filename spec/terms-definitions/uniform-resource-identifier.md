[[def: Uniform Resource Identifier, Uniform Resource Identifiers, URI, URIs]]
~ A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is the generic standard for all types of [[ref: identifiers]] used to link resources in the World Wide Web. The most common type of a URI is a URL ([[ref: Uniform Resource Locator]]). The URI standard is defined by [IETF RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986). URNs ([[ref: Uniform Resource Names]]) are another type of URIs intended for persistent [[ref: identifiers]].
