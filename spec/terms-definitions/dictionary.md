[[def: dictionary, dictionaries]]

~ A dictionary is a listing of lexemes (words or [[ref: terms]]) from the lexicon of one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically, which may include information on [[ref: definitions]], usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation, etc. It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the [[ref: data]]. Unlike a [[ref: glossary]], a dictionary may provide multiple [[ref: definitions]] of a [[ref: term]] depending on its [[ref: scope]] or context.
