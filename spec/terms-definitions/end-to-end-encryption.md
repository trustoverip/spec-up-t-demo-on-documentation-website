[[def: end-to-end encryption, end-to-end encrypt]]

~ [[ref: Encryption]] that is applied to a [[ref: communication]] before it is transmitted from the sender’s [[ref: communication endpoint]] and cannot be [[ref: decrypted]] until after it is received at the receiver’s [[ref: communication endpoint]]. When end-to-end encryption is used, the [[ref: communication]] cannot be [[ref: decrypted]] in transit no matter how many [[ref: intermediaries]] are involved in the [[ref: routing]] process.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption): End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a private communication system in which only communicating users can participate. As such, no one, including the communication system provider, [telecom providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_service_providers), [Internet providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_providers) or malicious actors, can access the [cryptographic keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_\(cryptography\)) needed to converse. End-to-end [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) is intended to prevent data being read or secretly modified, other than by the true sender and recipient(s). The messages are encrypted by the sender but the third party does not have a means to decrypt them, and stores them encrypted. The recipients retrieve the encrypted data and decrypt it themselves.
