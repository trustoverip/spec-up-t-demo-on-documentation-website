[[def: trustworthiness]]

~ An [[ref: attribute]] of an [[ref: entity]], such as a [[ref: person]] or [[ref: organization]], that provides confidence to others of the qualifications, capabilities, and reliability of that [[ref: entity]] to perform specific tasks and fulfill assigned responsibilities. Trustworthiness is also a characteristic of information technology products and systems. The attribute of trustworthiness, whether applied to people, processes, or technologies, can be measured, at least in relative terms if not quantitatively. The determination of trustworthiness plays a key role in establishing [[ref: trust relationships]] among [[ref: persons]] and [[ref: organizations]]. The [[ref: trust relationships]] are key factors in [[ref: risk decisions]] made by senior leaders/executives.
