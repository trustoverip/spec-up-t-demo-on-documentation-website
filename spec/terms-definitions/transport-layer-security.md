[[def: Transport Layer Security]]
~ Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide [[ref: communications]] security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and [[ref: Voice over IP]], but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible. The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide security, including privacy ([[ref: confidentiality]]), integrity, and [[ref: authenticity]] through the use of cryptography, such as the use of [[ref: certificates]], between two or more communicating computer applications.
