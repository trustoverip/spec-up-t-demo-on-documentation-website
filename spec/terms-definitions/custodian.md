Depending on the [[ref: custodianship arrangement]], the custodian may act as an exchange and provide additional services, such as staking, lending, account recovery, or security features.

~ Supporting definitions:

~ [NIST-CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/custodian): A third-party [[ref: entity]] that holds and safeguards a user’s [[ref: private keys]] or digital assets on their behalf. Depending on the system, a custodian may act as an exchange and provide additional services, such as staking, lending, account recovery, or security features.

~ Note: While a custodian technically has the necessary access to in theory [[ref: impersonate]] the [[ref: principal]], in most cases a custodian is expressly prohibited from taking any action on the [[ref: principal]]’s account unless explicitly [[ref: authorized]] by the [[ref: principal]]. This is what distinguishes custodianship from [[ref: guardianship]].
