~ A system for the management of [[ref: cryptographic keys]] and their [[ref: metadata]] (e.g., generation, distribution, storage, backup, archive, recovery, use, [[ref: revocation]], and destruction). An automated key management system may be used to oversee, automate, and secure the key management process. A key management is often protected by implementing it within the [[ref: trusted execution environment]] (TEE) of a device. An example is the [[ref: Secure Enclave]] on Apple iOS devices.
