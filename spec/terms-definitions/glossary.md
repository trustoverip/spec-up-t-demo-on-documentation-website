[[def: glossary, glossaries]]
~ A glossary (from Ancient Greek: γλῶσσα, glossa; language, speech, wording), also known as a _vocabulary_ or _clavis_, is an alphabetical list of [[ref: terms]] in a particular domain of [[ref: knowledge]] ([[ref: scope]]) together with the [[ref: definitions]] for those terms. Unlike a [[ref: dictionary]], a glossary has only one [[ref: definition]] for each term.
