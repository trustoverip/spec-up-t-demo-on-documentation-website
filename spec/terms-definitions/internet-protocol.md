[[def: Internet Protocol]]

~ The Internet Protocol (IP) is the network layer [[ref: communications]] protocol in the Internet protocol suite (also known as the [[ref: TCP/IP]] suite) for relaying [[ref: datagrams]] across network boundaries. Its [[ref: routing]] function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. IP has the task of delivering [[ref: packets]] from the source host to the destination host solely based on the [[ref: IP addresses]] in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines [[ref: packet]] structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.
