[[def: governance graph, governance graphs]]

~ A graph of the [[ref: governance]] relationships between [[ref: entities]] with a [[ref: trust community]]. A governance graph shows which [[ref: nodes]] are the [[ref: governing bodies]] and which are the [[ref: governed parties]]. In some cases, a governance graph can be traversed by making queries to one or more [[ref: trust registries]].Note: a [[ref: party]] can play both [[ref: roles]] and also be a participant in multiple [[ref: governance frameworks]].
