[[def: trust network, trust networks]]

~ A network of [[ref: parties]] who are connected via [[ref: trust relationships]] (such as via a membership agreement) conforming to [[ref: requirements]] defined in a legal regulation, [[ref: trust framework]] or [[ref: governance framework]]. A trust network is more formal than a [[ref: digital trust ecosystem]]; the latter may connect parties more loosely via transitive trust relationships and/or across multiple trust networks.
