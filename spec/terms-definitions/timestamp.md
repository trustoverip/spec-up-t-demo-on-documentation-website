Through mechanisms, such as the [Network Time Protocol](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/Network-Time-Protocol), a computer maintains accurate current time, calibrated to minute fractions of a second. Such precision makes it possible for networked computers and applications to communicate effectively.
