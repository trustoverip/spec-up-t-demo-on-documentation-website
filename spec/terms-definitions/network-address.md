[[def: network address, network addresses]]

~ A network address is an [[ref: identifier]] for a [[ref: node]] or [[ref: host]] on a telecommunications network. Network addresses are designed to be unique [[ref: identifiers]] across the network, although some networks allow for local, private addresses, or locally administered addresses that may not be unique. Special network addresses are allocated as [[ref: broadcast]] or [[ref: multicast]] addresses. A network address designed to address a single device is called a [[ref: unicast address]].
