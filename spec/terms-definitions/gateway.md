[[def: gateway, gateways]]

~ A gateway is a piece of networking hardware or software used in telecommunications networks that allows [[ref: data]] to flow from one discrete network to another. Gateways are distinct from [[ref: routers]] or switches in that they communicate using more than one protocol to connect multiple networks[<sup>\[1\]\[2\]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_\(telecommunications\)#cite_note-1) and can operate at any of the seven layers of the open systems interconnection model (OSI).
