[[def: trusted third party, trusted third parties, trusted 3rd party, trusted 3rd parties, TTP, TTPs]]

~ In [[ref: cryptography]], a trusted [[ref: third party]] (TTP) is an entity which facilitates interactions between two [[ref: parties]] who both trust the third party; the third party reviews all critical transaction communications between the parties, based on the ease of creating fraudulent digital content. In TTP models, the [[ref: relying parties]] use this trust to secure their own interactions. TTPs are common in any number of commercial transactions and in cryptographic digital transactions as well as cryptographic protocols, for example, a [[ref: certificate authority]] (CA) would issue a [[ref: digital certificate]] to one of two [[ref: parties]]. The CA then becomes the TTP to that certificate's issuance. Likewise transactions that need a third party recordation would also need a third-party repository service of some kind.
