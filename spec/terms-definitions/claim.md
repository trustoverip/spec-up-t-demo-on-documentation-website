[[def: claim, claims, claimed, claiming]]
~ An assertion about a [[ref: subject]], typically expressed as an [[ref: attribute]] or [[ref: property]] of the [[ref: subject]]. It is called a “claim” because the assertion is always made by some [[ref: party]], called the [[ref: issuer]] of the claim, and the [[ref: validity]] of the claim must be judged by the [[ref: verifier]].

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity): A claim is a statement that one subject, such as a person or organization, makes about itself or another subject. For example, the statement can be about a name, group, buying preference, ethnicity, privilege, association or capability.

~ Note: If the [[ref: issuer]] of the claim is also the [[ref: subject]] of the claim, the claim is [[ref: self-asserted]].
