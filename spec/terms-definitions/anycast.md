[[def: anycast]]

~ Anycast is a network [[ref: addressing]] and [[ref: routing]] methodology in which a single [[ref: IP-address]] is shared by devices (generally servers) in multiple locations. [[ref: Routers]] direct packets addressed to this destination to the location nearest the sender, using their normal decision-making algorithms, typically the lowest number of BGP network hops. Anycast [[ref: routing]] is widely used by content delivery networks such as web and name servers, to bring their content closer to end users.
