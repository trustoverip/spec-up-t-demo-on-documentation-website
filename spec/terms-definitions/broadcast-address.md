[[def: broadcast address, broadcast addresses]]

~ A broadcast address is a [[ref: network address]] used to transmit to all devices connected to a multiple-access [[ref: communications]] network. A [[ref: message]] sent to a broadcast address may be received by all network-attached [[ref: hosts]]. In contrast, a [[ref: multicast address]] is used to address a specific group of devices, and a [[ref: unicast address]] is used to address a single device. For network layer communications, a broadcast address may be a specific [[ref: IP address]].
