[[def: self-sovereign identity, SSI]]

~ Self-sovereign identity is a [[ref: decentralized identity]] architecture that implements the [[ref: Principles of SSI]] — principally that it puts the [[ref: identity controller]] (e.g., a [[ref: natural person]] or [[ref: organization]]) directly in control of the [[ref: identifiers]] and [[ref: credentials]] they use to assert their [[ref: digital identity]].

~ See also: [[ref: federated identity]].

~ Also known as: [[ref: SSI]].

~ Supporting definitions:

~ [eSSIF-Lab](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#ssi-self-sovereign-identity): SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) is a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) [parties](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/party) as they negotiate and execute electronic [transactions](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/transaction) with one another.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity): Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is an approach to [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity) that gives individuals control over the information they use to prove who they are to [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website), services, and [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) across the web. Without SSI, individuals with persistent accounts (identities) across the [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) must rely on a number of large identity providers, such as [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) (Facebook Connect) and [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) (Google Sign-In), that have control of the information associated with their identity.
